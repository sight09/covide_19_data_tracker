📊 ## Insights & Reflections

Countries experienced different pandemic waves; peaks varied regionally.

Vaccination rollouts slowed the growth of cases in some countries.

Death rates differ significantly across countries due to demographics, healthcare capacity, and reporting methods.

Data quality varies; handling missing and inconsistent values was crucial.
